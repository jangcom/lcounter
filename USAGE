NAME
    lcounter - Count the numbers of lines of text files

SYNOPSIS
        perl lcounter.pl [file ...] [-comment_symbs=symb ...] [-out=fname]
                         [-nofm] [-nopause]

DESCRIPTION
        lcounter counts the numbers of lines of designated text files.
        Multiple text files can be designated simultaneously and, therefore,
        the total numbers of lines of source code consisting of multiple
        module/package files can be counted as a whole.
        Lines are counted as:
        - Comment line
        - Blank line
        - Plain line

OPTIONS
        file ...
            Text files of interest.

        -comment_symbs=symb ... (short form: -comment, default: #)
            Comment symbols of the designated text files.
            Multiple symbols are separated by the comma (,).

        -out=fname (short form: -o, default: lcounter_result.txt)
            The file to which the counted numbers of lines will be written.

        -nofm
            The front matter will not be displayed at the beginning of the program.

        -nopause
            The shell will not be paused at the end of the program.
